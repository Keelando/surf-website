# TODO

Mandatory maintenance backlog from the 2026-07-19 repo audit. Work top-down;
check items off as they land. Full context in
`docs/project/MAINTAINABILITY_AUDIT_2026-07-14.md` and
`site/docs/ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md`.

- [x] **Consolidate CLAUDE.md** — one accurate root `CLAUDE.md`; deleted stale
      `docs/project/CLAUDE.md` + `site/docs/CLAUDE.md` (referenced dead
      scripts, pre-monorepo layout). *Done 2026-07-19.*
- [x] **Remove tracked `._codebase_digest.txt`** (2.5 MB generated dump at
      repo root) and gitignore it. *Done 2026-07-19.*
- [x] **Automate cache busting** (audit P4):
      `scripts/update_asset_versions.py` rewrites `?v=` to content hashes;
      pre-commit auto-fixes + stages; `tests/test_asset_versions.py` guards.
      *Done 2026-07-19.*
- [x] **Deduplicate `storm_surge_page.js` twin chart functions** (audit P2):
      shared scaffolding extracted (`baseSurgeChartOption`, `resolveStation`,
      `ensureChart`, `initStationSelector`, …); update functions now hold only
      their unique series logic. Pixel-verified against baseline screenshots.
      *Done 2026-07-19.*
- [x] **`stations-map.js` data-source unification**: marker/popup lookups
      share `latestStationData()`; wave-vs-wind classification + type labels
      moved to `shared/station-meta.js` (`isWaveStation`/`stationTypeLabel`),
      deduping four hardcoded type lists across three files and fixing the
      unlisted `land_based_wind_station` type. DOM-diff verified.
      *Done 2026-07-19.*
- [x] **Repo hygiene** (audit P5): deleted `archive/` (56 tracked files);
      moved `validate_stations.py` (now reads `lib.config.STATIONS_FILE`)
      and `create_lightstation_db.py` to `scripts/utils/`; removed stale
      root lint/test output files (`.gitignore` already covers them).
      *Done 2026-07-19.* Naming drift (`-v4` suffixes, snake vs kebab)
      stays opportunistic — fix when files are touched anyway.
- [x] **Hardcoded DB paths → `lib/config.py`**: added `WEATHER_DATABASE` +
      `LIGHTSTATION_DATABASE`; converted the four listed scripts plus the
      four lightstation scripts, `health_check.py`'s six copies, and
      `parse_lightstation.py`'s hardcoded `~/envcan_wave` data dirs
      (→ `PROJECT_ROOT`). *Done 2026-07-19.*
- [x] **Accessibility remainder** (`site/docs/ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md`): skip
      link, `aria-current`, ECharts aria descriptions, labeled nav
      landmarks, heading-order fixes, visible tide-select focus ring,
      `prefers-reduced-motion` — all landed and runtime-verified;
      analytics.html left as accepted. *Done 2026-07-19.*

Deferred by choice (revisit only if they hurt): `health_check.py` split
(836 lines); HTML `<head>` boilerplate duplication (no build step by design).

**Next feature** (not maintenance): Salish Sea forecast upgrade — RDWPS waves
+ CIOPS-SalishSea water levels. Plan: `docs/project/FORECAST_UPGRADE.md`.

## Feature backlog

Consolidated 2026-07-19 from the former `docs/project/TODO.md` (now
`WORKLOG.md`, completed-work history only). Roughly by priority:

- [ ] **Tighten graph margins** (medium): start with the buoys page ECharts
      (grid left/right/top/bottom, container padding), then audit the other
      chart pages. Prefer a shared pattern over per-page one-offs.
- [ ] **Dev branch + preview subdomain** (medium, DEFERRED 2026-08-15):
      `dev` branch served at `dev.halibutbank.ca` via a second Caddy site
      block + git worktree (`git worktree add ~/envcan_wave-dev dev`),
      symlink `site/data` for live data. Frontend preview only; backend
      stays on `main`. **Decision:** new/additive features preview as
      unlisted pages on `main` instead (noindex meta, no nav/sitemap
      link; promotion = nav + sitemap + drop noindex + add to test
      suites). Revisit this item only for risky changes to shared or
      existing surfaces (nav, shared CSS/JS, in-place page reworks).
- [ ] **Lighthouse performance reports** (medium): automated runs for key
      pages, track perf/a11y/SEO over time.
- [ ] **Back-to-top button** (low-medium; mobile-first): additive only — no
      nav changes, no library. Circular button, bottom-right thumb zone,
      ≥44px target, clears the gesture bar and warning banner. Hidden until
      ~1 viewport of scroll, fades in/out, hides at page bottom. Theme vars
      for light/dark, accessible label, keyboard-activatable,
      `prefers-reduced-motion` → instant jump, `addEventListener` only.
- [ ] **Mobile ECharts touch behavior** (open bug-ish): cursor/tooltip
      interaction is "funky" on mobile across chart pages; investigate
      ECharts touch/tooltip config, test on real devices.
- [ ] **Map marker decluttering** (low): markers overlap at zoomed-out
      levels, and the station count keeps growing (55 plotted as of
      2026-08-13, 3 added that day). Options: offset/spiderfy colliding
      markers, or thin them by zoom level so only major stations show when
      zoomed out. Until this lands, the buoy map's desktop start zoom is a
      straight trade — it moved 8 → 9 on 2026-08-13, which drops 15 of the
      38 initially-visible stations (all of Haro Strait, Juan de Fuca and
      the west coast) in exchange for legible spacing. Solving this reopens
      that choice; see `initStationsMap` in `site/assets/js/stations-map.js`.
- [ ] **Stop guessing timestamps to find EC data** (policy, do first): MSC's
      usage policy says plainly "Do not request directory listings to assess
      the availability of new data, the AMQPS notification service must be
      used for this need". `scripts/fetch/fetch_lightstation.py` does exactly
      that — it walks `dd.weather.gc.ca/today/bulletins/alphanumeric/.../FP/
      CWVR/HH/` hourly, guessing the last two likely report hours. It is also
      probably redundant: `config/sr3/bc_lightstation_obs.conf` already has
      `accept .*FPCN61.*` and FPCN61 files are arriving in
      `data/lightstation_bulletins/`. See the footprint section of
      `docs/DATA_FEEDS.md`.
- [ ] **Audit duplicate lightstation fetching** (medium): a manual backup
      source was added while debugging why the Tofino-area lightstations
      weren't populating, and it was never removed. Work out whether the HTTP
      poller and the sr3 subscription are genuinely redundant paths we rely
      on, or just duplicate work — and if the former, document *why* so it
      doesn't get "cleaned up" later. Pairs with the item above; do them
      together since they touch the same feed.
- [ ] **Why are English Bay and Southern Georgia Strait so chatty?** (low):
      those two buoys publish ~4,300 and ~4,100 files/day against ~715/day for
      Halibut Bank, La Perouse and Sentry Shoal — 6× the others, and 80% of
      our whole Datamart download volume (measured 2026-08-15). Could be
      genuinely higher-rate instruments, could be duplicate postings we could
      filter. Note `bc_wind_stations.conf` carries
      `reject .*minute-swob\.xml.*` but `bc_buoys.conf` has no equivalent.
- [ ] **Spread out the storm-surge fetch** (small): `fetch_storm_surge.py` is
      2,894 requests/day — 5× the wave forecaster and our largest HTTP load by
      far — because it pulls all 241 hourly steps of the 10-day GDSPS forecast
      for 6 stations. The same taper the wave fetcher now uses would cut it
      hard: hourly to 48 h then 3-hourly to 240 h is 113 steps (−53%,
      ~1,360/day); uniform 3-hourly is 81 steps (−66%, ~972/day). Touches a
      live user-facing chart, so check the storm-surge page still reads well
      at coarser resolution before committing.
- [ ] **Backend data audit** (low, rainy-day): compare captured fields vs
      what EC SWOB-ML / NOAA feeds actually provide; parser-log error sweep;
      schema/index review; per-station completeness stats.

Frontend polish, added 2026-08-15 — all four **done 2026-08-15**:

- [x] **Forecasts page: "coming soon" flag for RDWPS waves** — `.forecast-coming-soon`
      callout above `#forecast-container` in `forecasts.html` (styles in that
      page's own `<style>` block; remove both when waves ship).
- [x] **Winds page: condense + collapse the footnote wall** — caveat text in
      `config/stations.json` shortened, and `renderCaveatFootnotes`
      (`wind-stations.js`) now wraps the notes in a collapsed
      `<details class="station-caveat-notes">` ("Station notes (N)"), 29 px
      instead of a four-paragraph wall. A delegated click handler opens the
      `<details>` before an asterisk jump, since a collapsed one hides the
      target from fragment navigation.
- [x] **Forecasts page: reorder Related Resources** — Wind & Pressure Maps now
      precedes Aviation Forecasts.
- [x] **Footer health indicator: reporting-fraction color thresholds** —
      `footer.js` drives the badge from reporting % (green ≥ 93, yellow ≥ 75,
      red below) instead of `overall_status`. `data_freshness` is excluded from
      the escalation path (the fraction already covers it); the other checks —
      storage, database integrity, export freshness — can still force the badge
      worse, so a broken pipeline never shows green.
